# PowerPulse: Household Energy Usage Forecast

PowerPulse is a machine learning project that analyzes and forecasts household energy consumption using historical usage data. It applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis to reveal trends and consumption patterns. Multiple regression and deep learning models are built to deliver accurate energy predictions. The project supports improved energy planning, cost optimization, and smart-grid analytics.

## Features

PowerPulse offers complete analytics and forecasting for household power usage. It includes detailed EDA, outlier detection, and feature engineering to enhance model performance. Multiple regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are implemented and compared. Insightful visualizations help users understand consumption patterns and model results clearly.


## Skills

This project builds strong skills in data preprocessing, time-series handling, and exploratory data analysis. It enhances feature engineering abilities through time-based and statistical transformations. Users gain experience training models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM. Strong evaluation skills are developed using RMSE, MAE, and R² for accurate model assessment.
## Usage/Examples

Users can run the notebook to explore energy trends, detect anomalies, and understand consumption patterns. The project demonstrates preprocessing, splitting data, and training multiple regression models. Evaluation metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² help compare model performance. The workflow is reproducible and customizable for deeper experimentation or additional models.
